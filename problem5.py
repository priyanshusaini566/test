Practice Problem: Write a program to swap the values of two variables, a and b, without using a third temporary variable.

Exercise Purpose: This exercise will help you learn about memory efficiency and Python’s special tuple unpacking feature. In other languages like C or Java, you need a temporary variable to swap values safely. In Python, you can swap values in one line without risking data loss.

Given Input: a = 5, b = 10

Expected Output:

Before Swap: a = 5, b = 10
After Swap: a = 10, b = 5

"""

a=5
b=10
n=a

print("Before Swap: a=",a," b= ",b)

a=b
b=n

print("After Swap: a=",a," b= ",b)
