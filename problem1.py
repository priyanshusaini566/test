Practice Problem: Write a Python function that accepts two integer numbers. If the product of the two numbers is less than or equal to 1000, return their product; otherwise, return their sum.

Exercise Purpose: Learn basic control flow and the use of if-else statements. Understand how code decisions change output based on a mathematical threshold.

Given Input:

Case 1: number1 = 20, number2 = 30
Case 2: number1 = 40, number2 = 30
Expected Output:

The result is 600
The result is 70

"""
number1=int(input("Enter the number : "))
number2=int(input("Enter the number : "))

if number1*number2<1000:
    print(number1*number2)

else:
    print(number1+number2)
